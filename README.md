# GPT Language Model

This repository contains an implementation of a language model based on GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). The project explores the usage of GPT architecture for generating human-like text, demonstrating its capabilities in natural language processing tasks.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to build and experiment with a GPT-based language model. The notebook guides you through the process of setting up the model, training it on custom datasets, and generating text outputs.

## Files
